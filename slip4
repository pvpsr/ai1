Q.1)Write a program to implement Hangman game using python.                          
Description: 
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The user should guess the word correctly by 
entering alphabets of the user choice. The Program will get input as single alphabet from the 
user and it will matchmaking with the alphabets in the original  



word = "APPLE"
guessed = []
attempts = 6

print("Hangman Game")

while attempts > 0:
    # Print current status
    display = ""
    for ch in word:
        if ch in guessed:
            display += ch + " "
        else:
            display += "_ "
    print("\nWord:", display)

    # Check win
    if "_" not in display:
        print("You guessed it! The word is", word)
        break

    g = input("Enter a letter: ").upper()

    if g in guessed:
        print("Already guessed!")
        continue

    guessed.append(g)

    if g not in word:
        attempts -= 1
        print("Wrong! Attempts left:", attempts)

if attempts == 0:
    print("You lost! The word was", word)



Q.2) Write a Python program to implement Breadth First Search algorithm. Refer the following 
graph as an Input for the program.[Initial node=1,Goal node=8]


from collections import deque

# Graph based exactly on your diagram
graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [4, 5],
    3: [6, 7],
    4: [8],
    5: [8],
    6: [8],
    7: [8],
    8: []
}

def bfs(start, goal):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    print("BFS Traversal:")

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node, end=" ")

        if node == goal:
            print("\nGoal Found!")
            return

        visited.add(node)

        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            if neighbour not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbour)

# Run BFS
bfs(1, 8)
