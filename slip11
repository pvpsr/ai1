Q.1) Write a python program using mean end analysis algorithmproblem of transforming a string of 
lowercase letters into another string.

# Means-End Analysis to transform one string into another

def means_end_analysis(start, goal):
    print("Start:", start)
    print("Goal :", goal)

    start = list(start)
    goal = list(goal)

    steps = 0

    for i in range(len(start)):
        if start[i] != goal[i]:
            print(f"Step {steps+1}: Change '{start[i]}' to '{goal[i]}' at position {i}")
            start[i] = goal[i]
            steps += 1
            print("Current:", "".join(start))

    print("\nFinal Output:", "".join(start))


# Example
s1 = "abcde"
s2 = "axcye"
means_end_analysis(s1, s2)



Q.2) Write a Python program to solve water jug problem. Two jugs with capacity 4 gallon and 3 
gallon are given with unlimited water supply respectively. The target is to achieve 2 gallon of 
water in second jug.

# Water Jug Problem: Jug A = 4L, Jug B = 3L, Target = 2L in Jug B

def water_jug():
    A, B = 0, 0       # start with empty jugs
    steps = []

    while True:
        if B == 2:    # goal reached
            steps.append((A, B))
            break

        if A == 0:            # fill jug A
            A = 4
        elif B == 3:          # empty jug B
            B = 0
        else:                 # pour A -> B
            pour = min(A, 3 - B)
            A -= pour
            B += pour

        steps.append((A, B))

    print("Steps to reach 2 gallons in Jug B:")
    for s in steps:
        print(s)

water_jug()
