Q.1) Write a python program to sort the sentence in alphabetical order? 


sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

words = sentence.split()          # split into words
words.sort()                      # sort alphabetically

print("Sorted sentence:")
for w in words:
    print(w)



Q.2) Write a Python program to simulate n-Queens problem.


def solve(board, row, n):
    if row == n:
        for r in board:
            print(" ".join(str(x) for x in r))
        print()
        return

    for col in range(n):
        if safe(board, row, col, n):
            board[row][col] = 1
            solve(board, row + 1, n)
            board[row][col] = 0

def safe(board, row, col, n):
    # Check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i][col] == 1:
            return False
    # Check left diagonal
    i, j = row, col
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
        i -= 1; j -= 1
    # Check right diagonal
    i, j = row, col
    while i >= 0 and j < n:
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
        i -= 1; j += 1
    return True

n = int(input("Enter N for N-Queens: "))
board = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

print("Solutions:")
solve(board, 0, n)
