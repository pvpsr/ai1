Q.1) Write a python program to remove punctuations from the given string? 

# Python program to remove punctuations from a string

punctuations = '''!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~'''

# Input string
text = input("Enter a string: ")

# Removing punctuations
result = ""

for char in text:
    if char not in punctuations:
        result = result + char

print("String without punctuations:", result)




Q.2) Write a Python program to implement Depth First Search algorithm. Refer the following graph 
as an Input for the program.[Initial node=2,Goal node=7]


# DFS implementation for the given graph

# Graph based on the image
graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 4, 5],
    3: [1, 4],
    4: [2, 3, 7],
    5: [2, 6, 7],
    6: [5, 7],
    7: [4, 5, 6]
}

visited = []

def dfs(graph, node, goal):
    if node not in visited:
        visited.append(node)
        print(node, end=" ")

        if node == goal:
            return True

        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            if dfs(graph, neighbour, goal):
                return True
    return False


# Driver code
start = 2
goal = 7

print("DFS Traversal starting from node", start)
dfs(graph, start, goal)
print("\nGoal node", goal, "reached!")
