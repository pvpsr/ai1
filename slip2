Q.1) Write a python program to generate Calendar for the given month and year?

import calendar

# Input month and year
year = int(input("Enter year: "))
month = int(input("Enter month (1-12): "))

# Display the calendar
print("\nCalendar for", month, "/", year)
print(calendar.month(year, month))




Q.2)Write a Python program to implement Depth First Search algorithm. Refer the following graph 
as an Input for the program.[Initial node=1,Goal node=7].


# DFS Algorithm Implementation

# Graph based on the provided diagram
graph = {
    1: [3, 2],
    2: [4],
    3: [5, 2],
    4: [6],
    5: [3, 7, 4],
    6: [7],
    7: []
}

visited = []

def dfs(graph, node, goal):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node, end=" ")
        visited.append(node)

        if node == goal:
            return True  # Goal found

        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            if dfs(graph, neighbour, goal):
                return True

    return False


# Main
start = 1
goal = 7

print("DFS Traversal (starting from node 1):")
found = dfs(graph, start, goal)

print("\nGoal Found?" , found)
