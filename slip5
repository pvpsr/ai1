Q.1) Write a python program to implement Lemmatization using NLTK


from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import nltk

# Download wordnet once
# nltk.download('wordnet')

text = "The children are playing and the wolves were running fast"

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

words = text.split()

print("Original Text:")
print(text)

print("\nAfter Lemmatization:")
for w in words:
    print(w, "→", lemmatizer.lemmatize(w))



Q.2) Write a Python program to implement Breadth First Search algorithm. Refer the following 
graph as an Input for the program.[Initial node=1,Goal node=8] 


from collections import deque

# Graph (directed) based on the given diagram
graph = {
    1: [2, 4],
    2: [3],
    3: [2, 4, 6, 5],
    4: [],
    5: [7, 8],
    6: [8],
    7: [8],
    8: []
}

def BFS(start, goal):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print("Visiting:", node)

        if node == goal:
            print("\nGoal", goal, "found!")
            return

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

    print("Goal not found")

# Run BFS
BFS(1, 8)
