Q.1).Write a python program to remove stop words for a given passage from a text file using 
NLTK?. 


import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

nltk.download('stopwords')

# Read from file
with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

words = text.split()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
filtered = [w for w in words if w.lower() not in stop_words]

print("Original Text:")
print(text)

print("\nAfter Removing Stop Words:")
print(" ".join(filtered))



Q.2) Implement a system that performs arrangement of some set of objects in a room. Assume that 
you have only 5 rectangular, 4 square-shaped objects. Use A* approach for the placement of 
the objects in room for efficient space utilisation. Assume suitable heuristic, and dimensions of 
objects and rooms. (Informed Search) 


import heapq

# Room dimensions (length, width)
ROOM_W, ROOM_H = 10, 10

# Objects: (name, width, height)
rectangles = [("R1",3,2), ("R2",2,4), ("R3",3,3), ("R4",4,2), ("R5",2,3)]
squares    = [("S1",2,2), ("S2",3,3), ("S3",1,1), ("S4",2,2)]
objects = rectangles + squares

# A* heuristic → remaining area of objects
def heuristic(obj_list):
    return sum(w*h for (_,w,h) in obj_list)

# Check if object fits in remaining space
def fits(used_space, w, h):
    area_used = sum(a*b for (_,a,b) in used_space)
    return (area_used + w*h) <= ROOM_W * ROOM_H

# A* Search
def arrange():
    pq = []
    heapq.heappush(pq, (0, [], objects))  # (cost, placed, remaining)

    while pq:
        cost, placed, remaining = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if not remaining:
            return placed  # SUCCESS

        for i, (name,w,h) in enumerate(remaining):
            if fits(placed, w, h):
                new_placed = placed + [(name, w, h)]
                new_remaining = remaining[:i] + remaining[i+1:]
                g = sum(a*b for (_,a,b) in new_placed)
                h = heuristic(new_remaining)
                heapq.heappush(pq, (g+h, new_placed, new_remaining))

    return None

result = arrange()
print("Objects placed efficiently using A*:")
for name,w,h in result:
    print(f"{name} => {w}x{h}")
