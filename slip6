Q.1) Write a python program to remove stop words for a given passage from a text file using 
NLTK?.


# Step 1: Import required libraries
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Step 2: Download NLTK resources (only first time)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Step 3: Read text from a file
file_path = 'passage.txt'  # replace with your file name
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()

# Step 4: Tokenize the text into words
words = word_tokenize(text)

# Step 5: Get the list of English stop words
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Step 6: Remove stop words
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

# Step 7: Join filtered words back into a string
filtered_text = ' '.join(filtered_words)

# Step 8: Display the result
print("Original Text:\n", text)
print("\nText after removing stop words:\n", filtered_text)
