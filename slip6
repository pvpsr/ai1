Q.1) Write a python program to remove stop words for a given passage from a text file using 
NLTK?.


# Step 1: Import required libraries
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Step 2: Download NLTK resources (only first time)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Step 3: Read text from a file
file_path = 'passage.txt'  # replace with your file name
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()

# Step 4: Tokenize the text into words
words = word_tokenize(text)

# Step 5: Get the list of English stop words
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Step 6: Remove stop words
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

# Step 7: Join filtered words back into a string
filtered_text = ' '.join(filtered_words)

# Step 8: Display the result
print("Original Text:\n", text)
print("\nText after removing stop words:\n", filtered_text)



Q.2) Write a Python program to implement Breadth First Search algorithm. Refer the following 
graph as an Input for the program.[Initial node=1,Goal node=8]. 


from collections import deque
# Undirected graph from the given diagram
graph = {
    1: [2, 3, 4],
    2: [1, 4, 5],
    3: [1, 4],
    4: [1, 2, 3, 7],
    5: [2, 6, 7],
    6: [5, 7],
    7: [4, 5, 6]
}

def BFS(start, goal):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print("Visiting:", node)

        if node == goal:
            print("\nGoal", goal, "found!")
            return

        visited.add(node)

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    print("Goal not found")

# Run BFS (Goal node 8 does not exist but included for requirement)
BFS(1, 8)
