Q.1) Build a bot which provides all the information related to you in college

def college_bot():
    print("=== College Information Bot ===")
    print("Ask anything about: courses, fees, departments, timings, labs, staff, library, etc.")
    print("Type 'exit' to stop.\n")

    while True:
        query = input("You: ").lower()

        if query == "exit":
            print("Bot: Thank you! Have a great day!")
            break

        elif "course" in query:
            print("Bot: Our college offers BCS, BCA, BBA, BCom, MSc-CS, and MCA.")

        elif "fees" in query:
            print("Bot: Fees differ by course. Approx range is ₹25,000 – ₹45,000 per year.")

        elif "department" in query:
            print("Bot: We have CS, IT, Commerce, Management, and Science departments.")

        elif "timing" in query or "time" in query:
            print("Bot: College timing is 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.")

        elif "library" in query:
            print("Bot: The library has 10,000+ books and is open from 10 AM to 4 PM.")

        elif "lab" in query or "computer lab" in query:
            print("Bot: The computer lab has 50+ systems with internet access.")

        elif "staff" in query or "teacher" in query:
            print("Bot: All departments have well-qualified teaching and non-teaching staff.")

        elif "sports" in query:
            print("Bot: We provide cricket, football, badminton, kabaddi, chess, etc.")

        elif "canteen" in query:
            print("Bot: Canteen is open till 5 PM and provides hygienic food.")

        else:
            print("Bot: Sorry, I don't have information about that. Ask something else!")

Q.2) Write a Python program to implement Mini-Max Algorithm.


def minimax(depth, node_index, is_max, values, height):
    # Base case: if leaf node is reached
    if depth == height:
        return values[node_index]

    # If current move is of maximizer
    if is_max:
        return max(
            minimax(depth + 1, node_index * 2, False, values, height),
            minimax(depth + 1, node_index * 2 + 1, False, values, height)
        )
    else:
        # Minimizer move
        return min(
            minimax(depth + 1, node_index * 2, True, values, height),
            minimax(depth + 1, node_index * 2 + 1, True, values, height)
        )


# Driver code
values = [3, 5, 2, 9, 12, 5, 23, 23]   # leaf node values
import math
height = int(math.log(len(values), 2))

print("Leaf Node Values:", values)
print("Optimal Value (Using Minimax):", minimax(0, 0, True, values, height))
