Q.1) Python program that demonstrates the hill climbing algorithm to find the maximum of a 
mathematical function.  

def f(x):
    return -x*x + 4*x

step = 0.1
x = 0.0

while True:
    left  = f(x - step)
    right = f(x + step)
    best = f(x)

    if left > best:
        x = x - step
    elif right > best:
        x = x + step
    else:
        break

print("Maximum at x =", x)
print("Maximum value =", f(x))



Q.2) Write a Python program to implement A* algorithm. Refer the following graph as an Input for 
the program.[ Start vertex is A and Goal Vertex is G]
